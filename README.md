DISTINCT PARTITIONS: This is basically the answer to the question of "how many ways
are there to represent an integer as a sum of unique integers?"
For example if we want to find the answer for 6, we have
            6
            5 + 1
            4 + 2
            ------
  (illegal example: 3 + 3)
We have two possible combinations, so the answer of q(6) is 3.
